# PwC Telecom Retention Dashboard Project

## Introduction
Thrilled to share insights from my recent project at PwC through Forage, where I defined key performance indicators (KPIs) and crafted a tailored dashboard for a telecom industry client's Retention Manager. This project aimed to empower the client with real-time insights on customer retention metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making to enhance customer loyalty.

## Methodology
### Data Collection and Preparation
- Conducted thorough data collection from various sources within the telecom company, including customer databases, call logs, and survey responses.
- Cleaned and processed the data to ensure accuracy and consistency, resolving any discrepancies or missing values.

### KPI Definition
- Collaborated with stakeholders to define relevant KPIs aligned with the client's retention objectives and business goals.
- Conducted research and industry benchmarking to identify best practices and ensure the selected KPIs provided meaningful insights.

### Dashboard Design and Development
- Utilized Power BI as the primary tool for dashboard design and development, leveraging its advanced visualization capabilities and interactive features.
- Designed a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation and visually appealing layouts to facilitate ease of use for the Retention Manager.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard incorporates essential KPIs in a visually appealing format, including:
- **Customer Churn Rate**: Tracking the percentage of customers who discontinued service.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Estimating the total revenue a customer brings throughout their relationship with the company.
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: Measuring customer satisfaction and loyalty based on their likelihood to recommend the company.
- **Retention Rate**: Calculating the percentage of customers retained over a specific period.
- **Customer Engagement Metrics**: Analyzing usage patterns, interaction frequency, and feedback to gauge customer engagement.

## Dashboard Features
- Interactive Visualizations: Users can explore data dynamically through filters, slicers, and drill-down capabilities.
- Real-time Updates: The dashboard is designed to fetch and update data automatically, providing the latest insights at all times.
- Custom Alerts: Configured alerts to notify stakeholders of significant changes or anomalies in key metrics, enabling proactive response.

## Conclusion
Excited to have contributed to data-driven decision-making and supported the client in optimizing their retention strategies. This project has reinforced the importance of analytics in driving impactful results and innovation. Looking forward to leveraging these skills and experiences in future projects.
